        <p>A printer is a device that accepts text and graphic output from a computer and transfers the information to paper.</p>
        <p class="hr">***</p>
        <h2>Inkjet printers: </h2>
        <p>The Inkjet printer works on inkjet technology and produces better quality printouts than dot matrix
                printers. These print by spraying a controlled stream of tiny ink droplets accurately on the paper
                forming either dot matrix or solid characters. The printing quality of these printers is very good with a
                speed of 700 or more characters per second. These are non-impact and hence are relatively silent
                during the printing process. These printers are easy to use and can be used to print color pages. 
                </p>
        <h2>Laser printers: </h2>
        <p>This is a high quality, high speed and high volume technology printer. In laser printers, a laser beam
                is used to produce an image on a drum. The light of the laser alters the electrical charge on the drum
                wherever it hits it. The drum is then rolled through a reservoir of toner, which 1s picked up by the
                charged portionsof the drum. Finally, the toner 1s transferred to the paper through a combination of
                heat and pressure. Laser printers produce very high quality text and graphics but are expensive. The
                technology used by them is the same as that of photocopying machines. The speed of laser printers
                varies from 10 pages per minute to 200 page per minute. Laser printers are also called page printers;
                because they print a whole page at one go. </p>
        <h2>Printer Port: </h2>
        <p>Various pernpherals can be connected through parallel port, which 1s a parallel communication
                physical interface A parallel port transmits 8 bits of a byte of data in parallel. It 1s used for
                transmitting fast data over short distances It 1s used to connect a pmntei to a computer Since a
                parallel port transmits an entire byte at a time, it operates 1/O devices ata relatively high speed A
                Parallel port is prunanly used to connect printers to a computer and hence it 1s often called a printer
                port.
